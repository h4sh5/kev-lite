A low-calorie, unofficial mock-up for a compact KEV viewer. Features include:

* A basic table view for one-line summaries of vulnerabilities
* Expandable Details sections for each vulnerability
* Filtering across CVE IDs and vulnerability names
* A single page deployment that reads a local copy of the KEV JSON data

This is written using Bootstrap and JQuery, and much of the code was generated with ChatGPT.

Note, the real and official KEV, at https://cisa.gov/kev, is much more real and official. This is just a usability toy.
